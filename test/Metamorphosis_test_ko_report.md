## Translation Notes

### Key Decisions Made During Translation

1. **Creature Ambiguity**: Used "해충" (vermin/pest) rather than specific insect terms to preserve Kafka's deliberate vagueness about Gregor's transformed form.

2. **Literary Register**: Maintained formal literary Korean (문어체) throughout, appropriate for serious modernist fiction.

3. **Honorific System**: Deployed Korean speech levels to convey social hierarchy:
   - Chief clerk: Formal condescension
   - Mother: Gentle concern
   - Father: Authoritative to violent
   - Sister: Plaintive worry
   - Gregor: Excessive deference despite crisis

4. **Cultural Resonance**: Themes of filial duty, workplace hierarchy, and debt obligation resonate naturally with Korean cultural values, requiring no adaptation.

5. **Kafkaesque Tone**: Preserved the tragicomic absurdism where bureaucratic concerns override impossible physical crisis.

6. **Sentence Structure**: Maintained Kafka's long, complex sentences where natural in Korean, using connecting particles to preserve psychological flow.

7. **Time Notation**: Used Korean time format (6시 반, 7시 15분 전) for natural reading while preserving temporal urgency.

## Verification Summary

All six chunks received high quality scores (9.0-9.5/10). The verification process identified:
