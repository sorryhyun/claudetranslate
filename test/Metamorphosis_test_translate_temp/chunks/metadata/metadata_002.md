## Translation Metadata

### Translation Notes

- **Time references**: Maintained precise time markers (7시 15분, 7시 10분, 8시) as they are thematically crucial to mounting pressure and urgency.

- **Speech levels and honorifics**: Applied appropriate Korean speech levels to distinguish characters and their relationships:
  - Gregor's internal monologue: informal/casual (혼잣말)
  - Chief clerk: formal/authoritative speech (과장님, ~니다 endings)
  - Mother: respectful/worried tone (formal speech with concern)
  - Father: authoritative parental tone
  - Sister: intimate whisper (informal)

- **Physical descriptions**: Translated visceral details directly without euphemism ("등의 볼록한 부분" for "dome of his back", "작은 다리들" for "little legs") to maintain Kafka's matter-of-fact treatment of the transformation.

- **Dialogue integration**: Maintained the original paragraph structure where dialogue is integrated within narrative paragraphs rather than separated, preserving Kafka's narrative flow.

- **Workplace terminology**: Used Korean business terminology consistently with the glossary ("과장" for chief clerk, "외판원" for travelling salesman, "매출" for turnover).

- **Psychological realism**: Preserved the contrast between Gregor's surreal physical state and his mundane concerns about work, family obligations, and professional reputation through natural Korean phrasing.

- **Long sentence structures**: Attempted to maintain Kafka's characteristic long, complex sentences with multiple clauses where Korean syntax allows, reflecting Gregor's anxious, circular thinking patterns.

- **Cultural adaptation**: Translated expressions naturally ("무의미한 희망" for "nonsensical hope") while preserving the original meaning and emotional tone.

### Confidence Level

High - This is a straightforward narrative section with clear dialogue and action. The glossary provided excellent terminology consistency for key terms. The Korean translation captures both the absurdist situation and the mundane workplace drama effectively.

### Transition Notes

- **Beginning**: This chunk continues from Gregor's initial struggle in bed, now moving to his attempt to physically exit the bed while time pressure mounts.

- **Ending**: This chunk ends with Gregor having finally positioned himself upright against a chair after falling from bed, just as he prepares to listen to what the chief clerk has to say. The dramatic tension is at a peak—the family and chief clerk are outside the door, Gregor has made noise but hasn't yet revealed his transformed appearance, and his desperate explanations through the door have been delivered in an incomprehensible voice (though this is not yet fully revealed to the reader). The next chunk will likely involve Gregor's attempt to open the door and the revelation of his transformation to the others.
