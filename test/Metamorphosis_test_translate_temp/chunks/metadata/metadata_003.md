## Translation Metadata

### Translation Notes

- **Dialogue voices and register**: Carefully distinguished between the chief clerk's formal, authoritative speech (using formal Korean endings), the mother's emotional outbursts, and Gregor's increasingly desperate rational explanations. The chief clerk's cold formality contrasts with the family's panic.

- **Gregor's long monologue**: The extended speech where Gregor tries to reason with the chief clerk (lines 97-127) maintains Kafka's characteristic long, winding sentence structure. This reflects Gregor's anxious, desperate attempt to explain himself rationally while his appearance makes comprehension impossible. Korean syntax was adapted to preserve this breathless quality while remaining comprehensible.

- **Physical descriptions**: Translated visceral details literally—"다리 끝의 접착성 물질" (adhesive on leg tips), "갈색 액체" (brown fluid), "수많은 작은 다리들" (numerous little legs)—maintaining Kafka's matter-of-fact tone when describing grotesque transformation.

- **Temporal and spatial precision**: Preserved the detailed descriptions of the room layout, the hospital building across the street, breakfast items on the table, and the photograph of Gregor as lieutenant. These mundane details ground the surreal situation in concrete reality.

- **Glossary consistency**: Used established terms throughout—과장 (chief clerk), 외판원/상업용 여행판매원 (travelling salesman/commercial traveller), 자물쇠 수리공 (locksmith), 중위 (lieutenant), 난간 (banister), 현관 (entrance hall), 다리 끝의 접착성 물질 (adhesive on leg tips).

- **Cultural adaptation**: Religious exclamations adapted naturally—"Oh, God!" becomes "오, 세상에!" (Oh, heavens!) for the mother's initial cry, maintaining emotional intensity while fitting Korean expression patterns.

- **Tonal shifts**: Successfully navigated between Gregor's internal calm ("훨씬 더 침착해졌다"), the family's escalating panic, the chief clerk's cold retreat, and the father's emotional breakdown—each voice required different Korean sentence structures and vocabulary.

- **The key-turning scene**: Maintained the detailed physical comedy and horror of Gregor using his jaw to turn the lock despite having no proper teeth, with brown fluid dripping. The encouraging voices he imagines hearing ("잘했어, 그레고르") contrasts poignantly with the actual silence.

### Confidence Level

High - This chunk contains crucial dramatic action (Gregor's door-opening, the family's horrified reactions, Gregor's desperate monologue, the chief clerk's flight) that required balancing multiple registers and tones. The translation successfully maintains Kafka's distinctive blend of absurd horror and mundane realism, preserves the psychological depth of Gregor's rational explanations contrasting with his incomprehensible voice, and renders the visceral physical details without euphemism. The glossary terms were applied consistently, and the dialogue voices are appropriately distinguished through Korean speech levels.

### Transition Notes

- **Ending**: This chunk ends with Gregor's mother accidentally knocking over the coffee pot as she backs away in horror, shouting for help. She sits on the breakfast table without realizing it, coffee pouring onto the carpet. This sets up the next chunk's escalation—the father's violent intervention to drive Gregor back into his room. The scene has reached maximum chaos with the mother's panic, Gregor on the floor with his new legs, and the stage set for the father's aggressive response.
