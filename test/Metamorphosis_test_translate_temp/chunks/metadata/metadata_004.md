## Translation Metadata

### Translation Notes
- **Father's violence escalation**: Translated the father's aggressive actions with appropriate Korean verbs (몰아붙이다, 구르다, 밀어 넣었다) to convey the physical brutality while maintaining the matter-of-fact tone
- **Hissing sounds**: Used the Korean onomatopoeia "쉭쉭거리는 소리" which captures the threatening, animalistic quality of the father's sounds
- **Spatial complexity**: Carefully rendered the physical comedy and horror of Gregor's awkward backward movement and getting stuck in the doorway, using Korean directional verbs (뒤로 가다, 돌리다, 끼다)
- **Injury description**: Maintained the visceral quality of "흉한 갈색 자국" (vile brown flecks) and "심하게 출혈하는" (heavily bleeding) without euphemism, as required by Kafka's direct style
- **Walking stick as weapon**: The transformation of the chief clerk's stick into a weapon of violence was carefully translated to emphasize both its symbolic (borrowed authority used against family member) and literal (threat of lethal blow) dimensions
- **Time pressure dissolution**: The temporal urgency from earlier chunks dissolves here into pure physical action, reflected in longer action-oriented sentences
- **Narrative detachment**: Maintained the disturbing contrast between violent content and calm narrative voice, avoiding emotional intensifiers not present in the original

### Confidence Level
High - This climactic scene requires precise rendering of physical action, spatial relationships, and violent confrontation. The glossary provided excellent consistency for recurring terms (과장, 지팡이, 작은 다리들, 현관문, 자제력이 있는, 쉭쉭거리는 소리, 심하게 출혈하는, 흉한 갈색 자국). The translation maintains Kafka's characteristic blend of mundane horror and physical precision. Korean syntax naturally accommodates the long, complex sentences describing Gregor's awkward movements and the father's violent actions.

### Transition Notes
- Ending: The chunk concludes with complete closure - "마침내 모든 것이 조용해졌다" (finally, all was quiet). This represents the end of the opening sequence, with Gregor violently confined to his room, bleeding and injured. The door slammed shut creates a boundary between Gregor and the outside world. This is chunk 4 of 4, apparently ending the first section/chapter of the narrative. The silence that descends after the violent chaos establishes the new status quo: Gregor's isolation and imprisonment within his room, which will likely define the subsequent narrative development.
