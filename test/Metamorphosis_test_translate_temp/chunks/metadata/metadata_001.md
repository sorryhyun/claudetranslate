## Translation Metadata

### Translation Notes
- **Maintained ambiguity of transformation**: Used "해충" (vermin/pest) rather than specifying a particular insect type, preserving Kafka's deliberate vagueness about what Gregor has become.
- **Preserved complex sentence structure**: Kafka's long, winding sentences with multiple subordinate clauses were maintained in Korean where natural, using appropriate conjunctions and clause markers to mirror Gregor's anxious, circular thinking patterns.
- **Temporal precision**: All specific time references (6시 반, 7시 15분 전, 7시) were translated precisely to maintain the mounting pressure and urgency that drives the narrative.
- **Internal monologue**: Direct thought passages ("내게 무슨 일이 일어난 거지?", "오, 하느님") were translated to sound natural in Korean while preserving the psychological realism of Gregor's mental state.
- **Glossary consistency**: All pre-translated terms from the glossary were used consistently: 외판원 (travelling salesman), 직물 견본 (textile samples), 갑옷 같은 등 (armour-like back), 작은 다리들 (little legs), 자명종 (alarm clock), 사무보조원 (office assistant), 일을 회피하는 (workshy).
- **Cultural adaptation**: Religious exclamations like "God in Heaven!" and "Oh, God" were adapted to Korean expressions ("세상에!", "오, 하느님") that convey similar dismay while sounding natural.
- **Dialogue register**: Family members' speech was differentiated through appropriate Korean speech levels - mother's gentle concern, father's authoritative tone, sister's plaintive worry.
- **Visceral details**: Physical descriptions (갈색 배, 작은 하얀 점들, 타는 듯한 통증) were translated directly without euphemism, maintaining the unsettling sensory quality.
- **Workplace hierarchy**: Terms like "사무보조원" (office assistant) and "사장" (boss) convey the Korean workplace hierarchy that parallels the oppressive employer-employee relationship in the original.

### Confidence Level
High - This is the opening chunk of a canonical literary work with well-established Korean translation conventions. The glossary provided consistent terminology, the context analysis clarified tone and style requirements, and the source material is clear in its narrative intent. The translation maintains Kafka's characteristic blend of surreal premise with matter-of-fact narration, preserves the psychological depth of Gregor's internal monologue, and uses natural Korean while respecting the literary register appropriate for classic modernist fiction.

### Transition Notes
- **Ending**: The chunk ends with Gregor lying in bed at 7 o'clock, breathing lightly in the fog-shrouded morning, hoping that "complete stillness" might restore things to their natural state. This creates a contemplative pause before the escalation that follows. He has attempted and failed to get out of bed multiple times, establishing both his physical limitations and his anxious mental state regarding work obligations. The family has knocked on his door and received strange-voiced responses, setting up the social tension that will intensify in the next chunk.
- **Key setup for next chunk**: Time is now 7 o'clock (the next train departs at this hour), Gregor is still trapped in bed, his voice has alarmed his family, and he remains torn between desperate work obligations and physical inability to move. The next chunk likely involves escalating family concern and possibly the arrival of someone from his workplace, as foreshadowed by his anxiety about the office assistant reporting his absence.
