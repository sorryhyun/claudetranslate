## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9.5/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified. The translation maintains semantic accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and literary quality throughout.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
1. **Terminology Inconsistency** - Line 9 (Korean line 11)
   - Original: "pack up my samples"
   - Translation: "견본들을 싸서"
   - Glossary term: "textile samples" → "직물 견본"
   - Issue: The word "samples" alone is correctly translated as "견본들," and this is consistent with earlier usage where "textile samples" was introduced as "직물 견본." This is actually correct usage (shortened reference after initial full term), so this is not an issue.
   - Status: OK

2. **Stylistic Enhancement Opportunity** - Line 28
   - Original: "Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room
   - Translation: "들어봐요", 옆방의 지배인이 말했다
   - Issue: The speech level "들어봐요" (polite informal) is appropriate for the chief clerk speaking to the parents, but given the formal workplace context, "들어보세요" (polite formal) might better reflect the professional distance.
   - Suggestion: Consider "들어보세요" for more formal register matching the bureaucratic context
   - Impact: Minor stylistic preference; current choice is defensible

### Notes (Optional Improvements)
1. **Enhanced clarity for "soughing"** - Line 48
   - Translation: "바람 소리" (wind sound) is good
   - Alternative: "바람이 휘몰아치는 소리" could capture the more specific "soughing" quality (wind rushing through trees), but the simpler translation works well for readability

2. **Speech rhythm** - Lines 80-110
   - Gregor's long desperate speech is well-structured in Korean with appropriate connectors
   - The breathless quality is preserved through complex sentence structures
   - Excellent maintenance of psychological desperation beneath polite surface

### Tone Assessment
- **Formality**: Matches original - The translation maintains the formal literary register appropriate for serious modernist fiction, using 문어체 (written literary style) throughout
- **Voice**: Matches original - Third-person limited perspective closely following Gregor's consciousness is preserved; psychological intimacy maintained
- **Hierarchical speech levels**: Excellent differentiation:
  - Gregor to chief clerk: Extremely deferential (극존칭) with consistent use of "~시겠습니까?", "선생님", "~십니다", "제발"
  - Chief clerk to parents: Polite informal "~요" ending
  - Internal monologue: More neutral, appropriate for thought
- **Emotional register**: Successfully captures the tragicomic tension - matter-of-fact treatment of impossible situation, bureaucratic anxiety persisting through biological horror, desperate rationalization beneath polite surface
- **Overall feel**: Kafkaesque essence preserved - the unsettling blend of mundane practicality and surreal horror, dark humor, psychological depth

### Summary

This is an exceptional translation that demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both the source material and target language literary conventions. The translator has successfully navigated multiple complex challenges:

**Strengths:**
1. **Semantic precision**: Every nuance of meaning is preserved, from physical descriptions to psychological states
2. **Terminology consistency**: Perfect adherence to glossary terms with appropriate contextual variations
3. **Cultural adaptation**: Korean honorific system brilliantly deployed to convey workplace hierarchy, family dynamics, and social positioning
4. **Literary quality**: Maintains Kafka's formal literary register while achieving natural Korean flow
5. **Psychological depth**: The free indirect discourse blending narrator and protagonist's voice is expertly rendered
6. **Physical descriptions**: Clinical, matter-of-fact tone describing insect capabilities ("다리 끝의 접착력", "매우 강한 턱", "갈색 액체") preserves Kafka's unsettling precision
7. **Dialogue differentiation**: Each character's speech reflects their emotional state and social position through careful speech level selection
8. **Symbolic resonance**: Key imagery (door as barrier, key-turning as agency, military photo as lost dignity, individual raindrops as isolation) is preserved with cultural relevance
9. **Kafkaesque tone**: The absurd juxtaposition of mundane concerns with impossible reality is perfectly maintained

**Particularly impressive elements:**
- The door-opening sequence (lines 18-41) with its entomological precision and disturbing biological details
- Gregor's long desperate speech (lines 80-110) maintaining extreme deference while revealing panic beneath
- Family reaction differentiation showing mother's collapse, father's hostile grief, clerk's eerie retreat
- The contrast between imagined encouragement ("잘했어, 그레고르") and actual silence/horror
- Environmental grounding with mundane details (breakfast dishes, newspapers, rain, hospital building) anchoring surreal transformation

**Cultural resonance:**
The translation will resonate deeply with Korean readers through:
- Workplace subordination and hierarchical anxiety (직급 consciousness, 눈치)
- Family obligation and financial responsibility (효도, family debt)
- Shame and honor dynamics (체면)
- Military service respect culture
- Reputation vulnerability in gossip-prone environments

The translation achieves the delicate balance of preserving early 20th-century European setting while making psychological and social dynamics immediately accessible to Korean readers through universal human experiences.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Optional stylistic review**: Consider whether "들어보세요" would better serve the formal bureaucratic context than "들어봐요" in line 28, though current choice is defensible
2. **Final proofread**: Check for any minor typos (none detected in this review)
3. **Approve for assembly**: This translation is ready for integration into the final document
