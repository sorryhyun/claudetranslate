## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
1. **Terminology Consistency** - Line 7 (paragraph 2)
   - Issue: "그레고르 잠자" appears three times in paragraph 2, which follows the glossary but may read slightly awkward in Korean literary style. The repeated full name use is faithful to the original, but Korean narrative convention would typically use pronouns or titles after the first mention in close succession.
   - Note: This is a stylistic choice rather than an error - the translator correctly preserved Kafka's deliberate repetition, which serves a rhythmic and psychological function.

2. **Minor Phrasing** - Line 9 (beginning of paragraph 3)
   - Current: "잠시 후 그는 이미 너무 멀리 이동해서"
   - Issue: The phrase "너무 멀리 이동해서" is grammatically correct but could be slightly more natural as "이미 너무 많이 몸을 움직여서"
   - Impact: Minor - does not affect comprehension but slightly less fluid

3. **Speech Level Subtlety** - Line 13 (Father's dialogue)
   - Current: "그레고르 잠자야" (반말/informal)
   - Issue: The father uses informal speech to Gregor, which is appropriate for Korean parent-to-child dynamics. However, given the formal tone of the father's command and the presence of the chief clerk, a slightly more formal "그레고르" without the -야 ending might better reflect the father's authoritative yet public-facing manner
   - Impact: Minor cultural adaptation consideration

### Notes (Optional Improvements)
1. The translation of "swang himself" as "자신을 내던졌다" (threw himself) is effective and captures the forceful action. The past tense "swang" (archaic past tense of "swing") maintains the period literary style.

2. The handling of internal monologue versus dialogue is excellent, with clear distinctions maintained throughout.

3. The tragicomic balance in Gregor's thoughts about calling for help despite locked doors is well preserved with "이 생각에 미소를 억누를 수 없었다."

### Terminology Consistency Check
| Term | Expected (Glossary) | Found in Translation | Status |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Gregor Samsa | 그레고르 잠자 | 그레고르 잠자 | ✓ OK |
| chief clerk | 주임 | 주임 | ✓ OK |
| little legs | 작은 다리들 | 작은 다리들 | ✓ OK |
| fretsaw | 실톱 | 실톱 | ✓ OK |
| train timetables | 열차 시간표 | 열차 시간표 | ✓ OK |
| commerce | 상업 | 상업 | ✓ OK |
| elastic | 탄력 있는 | 탄력 있어서 | ✓ OK (grammatically adjusted) |
| business duties | 업무 책임 | 업무 책임 | ✓ OK |

### Tone Assessment
- **Formality**: Matches - The translation maintains Kafka's formal-literary register while remaining accessible. The deadpan narration of absurd circumstances is preserved.
- **Voice**: Matches - Third-person limited perspective with close psychological focus on Gregor is maintained. Active voice predominates as in the original.
- **Overall feel**: The tragicomic balance is expertly maintained. Gregor's rational deliberations about his impossible physical predicament, the mounting family anxiety, and the bureaucratic absurdity of the chief clerk's visit all come through clearly.

### Summary
This is an excellent translation that successfully captures Kafka's distinctive style - the matter-of-fact narration of impossible circumstances, the mounting psychological pressure, the bureaucratic absurdity, and the tragicomic tone. The translator has skillfully navigated the challenges of Korean honorifics to reflect family and workplace hierarchies while maintaining natural dialogue flow. Glossary terms are consistently and accurately applied. The temporal precision, physical descriptions, and emotional undertones are all well preserved.

The translation demonstrates strong understanding of both the source material's literary significance and the target language's narrative conventions. The few minor points noted above are stylistic considerations rather than errors, and the current translation choices are defensible and effective.

### Recommended Actions
1. Consider whether the repeated full name "그레고르 잠자" in paragraph 2 should be varied with pronouns for more natural Korean flow, or retained for Kafka's rhythmic effect (current choice is valid)
2. Optional: Review the phrase "너무 멀리 이동해서" in paragraph 3 for potential naturalness improvement to "너무 많이 몸을 움직여서"
3. Optional: Consider father's address form "그레고르 잠자야" for tonal consistency with his authoritative but public-facing situation

These are minor optimizations; the translation is already of high professional quality.
