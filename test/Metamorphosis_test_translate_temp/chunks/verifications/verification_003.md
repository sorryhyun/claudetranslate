## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified.

### Warnings (Should Fix)

1. **Terminology Inconsistency** - Line 11
   - Issue: "상업용 여행판매원" (commercial traveller) is used instead of the glossary's preferred "외판원" (travelling salesman)
   - Suggestion: While both are acceptable per the glossary, maintaining consistency with "외판원" would be better for coherence across chunks

2. **Minor Awkwardness** - Line 7
   - Original: "His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room."
   - Translation: "아버지는 적대적인 표정을 짓고 그레고르를 방으로 다시 밀어넣으려는 듯이 주먹을 쥐었다."
   - Issue: Slight restructuring changes emphasis; "적대적인 표정을 짓고" (made hostile expression) is slightly more explicit than the original's simple "looked hostile"
   - Suggestion: Consider "아버지는 적대적으로 보였고" for closer alignment, though current translation is acceptable

3. **Phrasing Choice** - Line 9
   - Original: "part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly"
   - Translation: "거리 반대편의 끝없이 이어지는 회색-검은색 건물—병원이었다—의 일부가... 아주 선명하게 보였다"
   - Issue: "끝없이 이어지는" (endlessly extending) is slightly more dynamic than "endless" suggests; the original emphasizes the building's imposing vastness as a static quality
   - Suggestion: "끝없는" (endless) alone might better preserve the static, oppressive quality

### Notes (Optional Improvements)

1. The translation excellently preserves Kafka's complex sentence structures, particularly in Gregor's long monologue (lines 11-12 of the translation), maintaining the circular, anxious quality of his thinking.

2. The handling of dialogue is natural and appropriately differentiated by character (mother's emotional cries, chief clerk's cold observations, Gregor's desperate pleading).

3. Strong preservation of sensory details: "갈색 액체가 나와 열쇠 위로 흘러" (brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key) maintains the visceral, disturbing quality.

4. Temporal precision is well-maintained throughout, crucial for the mounting pressure of the narrative.

### Terminology Consistency Check

| Term | Expected | Found | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| chief clerk | 과장 | 과장 | OK |
| locksmith | 자물쇠 수리공 | 자물쇠 수리공 | OK |
| adhesive on the tips of his legs | 다리 끝의 접착성 물질 | 다리 끝의 접착성 물질 | OK |
| little legs | 작은 다리들 | 작은 다리들 (also 수많은 작은 다리들) | OK |
| entrance hall | 현관 | 현관 | OK |
| commercial traveller | 외판원 | 상업용 여행판매원 | Minor variation |
| banister | 난간 | 난간 | OK |
| lieutenant | 중위 | 중위 | OK |

### Tone Assessment

- **Formality**: Matches - The semi-formal literary register is consistently maintained throughout, appropriate for classic modernist fiction
- **Voice**: Matches - Third-person limited perspective is preserved, with seamless transitions between Gregor's anxious internal thoughts and external observations
- **Overall feel**: The translation successfully captures Kafka's characteristic tone: matter-of-fact narration of absurd events combined with mounting psychological tension. The disturbing transformation is described with the same clinical detachment as mundane domestic details, which is essential to the work's impact.

### Summary

This is a high-quality translation that demonstrates strong command of both source and target languages. The translator has successfully navigated the considerable challenges of Kafka's style: complex syntax, psychological depth within absurd circumstances, and the balance between visceral physicality and emotional restraint.

Key strengths:
- Excellent preservation of Kafka's long, winding sentences that mirror Gregor's anxious mental state
- Natural Korean dialogue that maintains character differentiation
- Accurate rendering of physical/sensory details without euphemism
- Consistent maintenance of the matter-of-fact tone crucial to the text's impact
- Strong adherence to glossary terminology with only minor variations

The translation reads fluently in Korean while remaining faithful to the source text's meaning, tone, and stylistic qualities. The few warnings identified are minor and do not significantly impact comprehension or literary effect.

### Recommended Actions

1. Consider using "외판원" instead of "상업용 여행판매원" for consistency with the established glossary preference
2. Optional: Review the few phrasing choices noted above for even closer alignment with source nuances
3. No revision necessary - quality is excellent with no critical issues
