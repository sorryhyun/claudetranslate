## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified.

### Warnings (Should Fix)

1. **Terminology - Line 3**
   - Original: "horrible vermin"
   - Translation: "끔찍한 해충"
   - Issue: While "해충" is the glossary term and acceptable, the glossary specifically notes it should maintain ambiguity without specifying insect type. The current translation correctly uses 해충, but "끔찍한" (horrible/terrible) slightly differs from context note emphasis on repulsion and degradation.
   - Suggestion: Current translation is acceptable per glossary. No change needed.

2. **Stylistic Choice - Line 7**
   - Original: "조금 더 자면서 이 모든 헛소리를 잊어버리면 어떨까"
   - Translation accuracy: Correct
   - Issue: "헛소리" (nonsense) is perfectly acceptable, though some readers might prefer a slightly softer term given the literary register.
   - Suggestion: Consider "허튼 생각" or keep as-is. Current translation is valid and maintains the tone.

3. **Sentence Flow - Line 11**
   - Original complex sentence structure about train schedule is well-preserved
   - Issue: The Korean sentence starting "다음 기차는 7시에 간다" could benefit from slightly more natural flow connecting to the subsequent clauses about rushing and unpacked samples.
   - Suggestion: Current translation is grammatically correct and preserves complexity as required by style guidelines. Minor optimization possible but not necessary.

### Notes (Optional Improvements)

1. The translation excellently maintains Kafka's long, complex sentence structures while remaining comprehensible in Korean, adhering to the context analysis requirement to "maintain sentence length and complexity rather than over-simplifying."

2. The handling of time references ("7시 15분 전" for "quarter to seven") is precise and maintains the temporal urgency central to the narrative.

3. The shift between internal monologue and external narration is well-handled through natural Korean sentence-ending patterns.

4. Physical descriptions are visceral and direct, appropriately avoiding euphemism as recommended in the context analysis.

### Terminology Consistency Check

| Term | Expected | Found | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| vermin | 해충 | 해충 | OK |
| armour-like back | 갑옷 같은 등 | 갑옷 같은 등 | OK |
| travelling salesman | 외판원 | 외판원 | OK |
| Gregor Samsa | 그레고르 삼자 | 그레고르 삼자 | OK |
| textile samples | 직물 견본 | 직물 견본 | OK |
| alarm clock | 자명종 | 자명종 | OK |
| little legs | 작은 다리들 | 작은 다리들 (also 수많은 작은 다리들) | OK - appropriate variation |
| office assistant | 사무보조원 | 사무보조원 | OK |
| workshy | 일을 회피하는 | 일을 회피하는 | OK |

### Tone Assessment

- **Formality**: Matches - The translation maintains the semi-formal literary prose register recommended in the context analysis. Neither archaic nor overly colloquial, appropriate for classic literature.

- **Voice**: Matches - Third-person limited omniscient narration is preserved, with seamless integration of Gregor's internal thoughts and external descriptions. The use of indirect discourse (e.g., "그는 생각했다") properly maintains the narrative distance while staying intimate with the protagonist's perspective.

- **Overall feel**: Excellent match - The translation successfully captures Kafka's distinctive tone: disturbing and surreal yet matter-of-fact. The combination of the absurd (transformation into insect) with mundane realism (work obligations, family dynamics) is well-preserved. Gregor's anxious internal monologue comes through clearly in Korean.

### Summary

This is a high-quality literary translation that demonstrates strong adherence to both the source text and the established context guidelines. The translator has successfully navigated the challenging task of rendering Kafka's complex, anxious prose into Korean while maintaining:

1. **Semantic accuracy**: All content is faithfully preserved with no omissions or additions
2. **Syntactic complexity**: Long, winding sentences mirror the original's psychological depth
3. **Terminology consistency**: Glossary terms are used correctly and consistently
4. **Tonal fidelity**: The surreal-yet-mundane quality is maintained
5. **Cultural appropriateness**: Time references, workplace dynamics, and family hierarchy are handled naturally
6. **Literary register**: Appropriate formality level for classic literature

The translation reads naturally in Korean while respecting the source text's distinctive style. The only minor suggestions relate to optional stylistic preferences that do not affect the translation's fundamental accuracy or quality. This translation demonstrates professional-level competence in literary translation.

### Recommended Actions

1. No critical fixes required - translation is ready for final assembly
2. Optional: Consider reviewing line 7 "헛소리" if a slightly softer register is preferred for the literary context, though current choice is valid
3. Maintain this high standard of quality for subsequent chunks
