## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
1. **Inconsistent Name Usage** - Throughout the translation
   - Issue: The name "Gregor Samsa" is often rendered as "그레고르 잠자" in places where the original only uses "Gregor". This adds unnecessary formality and can sound awkward in Korean.
   - Example: Line 7 "Gregor was still there" → "그레고르 잠자는 아직 여기에 있었고" (should be "그레고르는 아직 여기에 있었고")
   - Example: Line 12 "for which Gregor could be sacked" → "그레고르 잠자가 즉시 해고당할 이유는" (should be "그레고르가 즉시 해고당할 이유는")
   - Example: Line 13 "seemed to Gregor" → "그레고르 잠자에게는" (should be "그레고르에게는")
   - Suggestion: Use "그레고르" for most occurrences unless the full name "Gregor Samsa" appears in the original. The glossary term "그레고르 잠자" should only be used when "Gregor Samsa" is explicitly written, not for every instance of "Gregor".

2. **Temporal marker inconsistency** - Line 54
   - Original: "I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well"
   - Translation: "저는 8시 기차로 출발할 거예요"
   - Issue: The phrase "as well" suggests continuation/addition to previous statement, which is slightly lost in translation
   - Suggestion: Consider "저도 8시 기차로 출발할 거예요" or "저 역시 8시 기차로 출발할 거예요" to capture the additive nuance

3. **Awkward phrasing** - Line 1
   - Translation: "그렇다면 왜 그의 여동생은 가서 다른 사람들과 합류하지 않은 것일까?"
   - Issue: "합류하지 않은 것일까" sounds overly formal for an internal question
   - Suggestion: "합류하지 않았을까?" would be more natural for this rhetorical internal monologue

### Notes (Optional Improvements)
1. Line 41 "beside himself" is translated as "자기도 모르게" (unknowingly/unconsciously), but "정신없이" (frantically/desperately) might better capture the emotional intensity of "beside himself with excitement"

2. Line 77 "Did you understand a word of all that?" uses "당신네들은" which is slightly archaic/dialectal. Modern Korean "여러분은" or simply maintaining the formal tone with "그 모든 말 중에 단어 하나라도 이해하셨습니까?" would be smoother

3. The phrase "말이 나온 김에" (line 21, "since we're on the topic") for "I mention this just by the way" is good colloquial Korean but slightly informal for the chief clerk's bureaucratic tone. "그저 부차적으로 언급하는 것이지만" would match his formality better

### Terminology Consistency Check
| Term | Expected | Found | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| Gregor Samsa | 그레고르 잠자 | 그레고르 잠자 (overused) | Mismatch* |
| chief clerk | 주임 | 주임 | OK |
| business duties | 업무 책임 | 업무 책임 | OK |
| turnover | 매출액 | 매출액 | OK |
| eight o'clock train | 8시 기차 | 8시 기차 | OK |
| attack of dizziness | 현기증 발작 | 현기증 발작 | OK |
| voice of an animal | 동물의 목소리 | 동물의 목소리 | OK |
| locksmith | 자물쇠 수리공 | 자물쇠 수리공 | OK |
| little legs | 작은 다리들 | 작은 다리들 | OK |

*Note: "Gregor Samsa" is correctly translated but overused - appearing in places where only "Gregor" exists in the original.

### Tone Assessment
- Formality: Matches - The chief clerk's bureaucratic escalation is well-preserved with appropriate formal Korean (존댓말/격식체), and the hierarchical relationships are maintained
- Voice: Matches - Active voice preserved throughout; stream-of-consciousness flow in Gregor's panicked explanation maintained effectively
- Overall feel: Excellent match - The translation captures Kafka's matter-of-fact tone in surreal circumstances, the mounting tension, and the tragicomic balance between Gregor's physical struggle and social crisis

### Summary
This is a high-quality translation that successfully preserves Kafka's characteristic deadpan tone, the escalating crisis atmosphere, and the complex interplay between bureaucratic formality and family panic. All glossary terms are used consistently and correctly. The translation demonstrates strong command of Korean speech levels appropriate to each character's relationship and emotional state. The main weakness is the overuse of the full name "그레고르 잠자" where only "그레고르" would be more natural, creating slight awkwardness in flow. The stream-of-consciousness passages, particularly Gregor's desperate explanations, are rendered with excellent fluency and naturalness. The critical turning point—the chief clerk's recognition that Gregor's voice is that of an animal—is translated with appropriate gravity and impact.

### Recommended Actions
1. Review all instances of "그레고르 잠자" and replace with "그레고르" where the original text only says "Gregor" (not "Gregor Samsa")
2. Consider minor phrasing adjustments for more natural flow in rhetorical questions and colloquial expressions
3. Evaluate whether some formal bureaucratic language could be slightly elevated to better match the chief clerk's pompous tone
