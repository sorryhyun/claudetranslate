## Verification Report

### Quality Score: 9/10

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
1. **Terminology Consistency** - Line 7
   - Issue: The phrase "외판원의 직업상 위험인 심각한 감기" uses "직업상 위험" but could be more naturally phrased
   - Current: "외판원의 직업상 위험인 심각한 감기"
   - Suggestion: "외판원의 직업상 위험으로 발생하는 심각한 감기" (adds clarity to the causal relationship)

2. **Minor awkwardness** - Line 9
   - Issue: "그러니 계속 시도하지 마" feels slightly informal given the formal-literary register
   - Current: "그러니 계속 시도하지 마"
   - Suggestion: "그러니 계속 시도하지 말자" (more aligned with internal monologue formality)

### Notes (Optional Improvements)
1. The translation of "quarter to seven" as "6시 45분" is accurate and maintains temporal precision well.
2. The handling of "squeaking" as "끽끽거리는 소리" effectively uses Korean onomatopoeia while preserving the insect-like quality.
3. Family terms (어머니/아버지/여동생) are appropriately chosen and maintain the hierarchical dynamics.
4. The long, complex sentence structures successfully preserve Kafka's stream-of-consciousness style without becoming incomprehensible.

### Terminology Consistency Check
| Term | Expected | Found | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| travelling salesman | 외판원 | 외판원 | OK |
| squeaking | 끽끽거리는 소리 | 끽끽거리는 소리 | OK |
| little legs | 작은 다리들 | 작은 다리들 | OK |
| occupational hazard | 직업상 위험 | 직업상 위험 | OK |
| bedpost | 침대 기둥 | 침대 기둥 | OK |
| wooden door | 나무 문 | 나무 문 | OK |
| morning fog | 아침 안개 | 아침 안개 | OK |
| cautious knock | 조심스러운 노크 | 조심스러운 노크 | OK |

### Tone Assessment
- Formality: Matches - The translation maintains the formal-literary register with accessible prose throughout. The deadpan, matter-of-fact narration of the impossible transformation is preserved.
- Voice: Matches - Third-person limited omniscient perspective through Gregor's consciousness is consistently maintained. The balance between external action and internal thought flows naturally.
- Overall feel: The translation successfully captures Kafka's distinctive style - the tragicomic balance between horror and dark comedy, the clinical precision in describing body movements, and the psychological realism despite the surreal premise. The Korean prose maintains both literary formality and psychological intimacy.

### Summary
This is a high-quality translation that successfully preserves the essential elements of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis." The translator demonstrates strong command of:
1. **Semantic accuracy**: All content is accurately rendered with no missing or added elements
2. **Tone fidelity**: The deadpan, matter-of-fact tone is perfectly maintained
3. **Cultural adaptation**: Korean family dynamics and speech levels are appropriately handled
4. **Literary quality**: Long, complex sentences preserve the stream-of-consciousness flow
5. **Terminology consistency**: All glossary terms are used correctly and consistently
6. **Tragicomic balance**: The blend of horror and dark comedy is preserved

The translation handles particularly well:
- The temporal precision (6시 45분, 7시) that builds mounting pressure
- Family dialogue that reflects concern and tension through appropriate Korean speech patterns
- Physical descriptions that balance clinical detail with visceral impact
- Gregor's psychological denial mechanisms and internal rationalization
- The matter-of-fact reporting of impossible circumstances

The two warnings identified are minor issues that would slightly improve naturalness but do not compromise comprehension or literary quality. The translation demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both source and target literary cultures.

### Recommended Actions
1. Consider the optional rephrasing of "직업상 위험인" to "직업상 위험으로 발생하는" for smoother causal flow (very minor improvement)
2. Optionally adjust "시도하지 마" to "시도하지 말자" to maintain consistency in internal monologue formality (stylistic preference)
