    {
      "source": "chief clerk",
      "translation": "과장",
      "context": "Official representative from Gregor's workplace who arrives to investigate his absence; speaks with authority and demands explanation from Gregor",
      "category": "proper_noun",
      "notes": "Used '과장' (department head/chief) to convey workplace authority and hierarchy. Alternative '수석 사무원' (chief office worker) is also valid but '과장' better captures the authoritative tone."
    },
    {
      "source": "travelling salesman",
      "translation": "외판원",
      "context": "Gregor's profession (though not directly mentioned in this chunk, implied by 'business' references and 'textile samples' mentioned earlier)",
      "category": "domain_specific",
      "notes": "Standard Korean term for traveling salesman. Maintains the commercial/business connotation essential to Gregor's identity and the story's economic anxiety."
    },
    {
      "source": "vermin",
      "translation": "벌레",
      "context": "The undefined creature Gregor has become; deliberately ambiguous in original, creating horror through non-specificity",
      "category": "technical",
      "notes": "Chose '벌레' (insect/creature) over '해충' (pest) to maintain the ambiguity of Kafka's original German 'Ungeziefer'. '벌레' is more neutral and allows disgust through context rather than the term itself."
    },
    {
      "source": "dome of his back",
      "translation": "등의 볼록한 부분",
      "context": "Physical description of Gregor's transformed body used to explain how others might help him move",
      "category": "domain_specific",
      "notes": "Translates the physical description literally. '볼록한 부분' (rounded protuberance) captures the dome-like shape that is tactilely important to the narrative."
    },
    {
      "source": "little legs",
      "translation": "작은 다리들",
      "context": "Multiple appendages Gregor now possesses; repeatedly referenced as he learns to navigate with them",
      "category": "technical",
      "notes": "Direct translation maintaining the diminutive quality ('작은' = little/small) that conveys both the creature's new form and Gregor's struggle to coordinate them."
    },
    {
      "source": "turnover",
      "translation": "매출",
      "context": "Business/sales metric; chief clerk criticizes Gregor's poor turnover performance recently",
      "category": "domain_specific",
      "notes": "Standard Korean business term for sales turnover. '매출' directly conveys the commercial metric that the chief clerk uses to criticize Gregor's work performance."
    },
    {
      "source": "commercial traveller",
      "translation": "상업용 여행판매원",
      "context": "Alternative term for Gregor's profession; indicates traveling salesman role",
      "category": "domain_specific",
      "notes": "More formal variant of travelling salesman. Could also use '외판원' for consistency with the primary term, but this fuller version emphasizes the 'commercial' aspect when needed for distinction."
    },
    {
      "source": "fretsaw",
      "translation": "실톱",
      "context": "Hobby tool mentioned by mother as evidence of Gregor's modest interests; used to make small wooden frames",
      "category": "technical",
      "notes": "Traditional Korean term '실톱' (jeweler's/fretsaw) specifically refers to this fine detail saw. Shows Gregor's modest, humble hobbies as an ordinary person before transformation."
