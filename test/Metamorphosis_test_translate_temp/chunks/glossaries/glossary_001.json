    {
      "source": "vermin",
      "translation": "해충",
      "context": "He found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. German 'Ungeziefer' is deliberately ambiguous and should not be translated as a specific insect type.",
      "category": "domain_specific",
      "notes": "Chosen over '벌레' to maintain the sense of repulsion and degradation while preserving ambiguity. '해충' conveys pest/noxious creature without specifying exact insect type, capturing Kafka's deliberate vagueness."

      "source": "Gregor Samsa",
      "translation": "그레고르 삼자",
      "context": "The protagonist who has mysteriously transformed. The text uses 'Gregor' as the primary name.",

      "category": "technical",
      "notes": "Direct, literal translation that preserves the simile structure and visceral quality of the original. '갑옷' (armor) conveys hardness and protection; '같은' maintains the comparative structure."

      "translation": "직물 견본",

      "translation": "자명종",
      "context": "The clock on the chest of drawers that failed to wake Gregor: 'he could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock.' Symbol of time pressure and obligation.",
