## Chunk 2 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor attempts to respond to his family's knocking through a locked door, revealing his voice has become unrecognizable with painful squeaking, then he tries unsuccessfully to get out of bed, discovering his body has transformed dramatically with multiple legs he cannot control. His increasingly desperate attempts to leave the bed fail as he grapples with the reality of his physical transformation while still minimizing it as merely a cold.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **voice answering**: Changed dramatically - squeaking and unclear, sets up communication barrier theme
- **little legs**: Multiple legs continuously moving uncontrollably - the physical reality of transformation becomes undeniable
- **lower part of his body**: Undefined and sensitive to pain - Kafka maintains ambiguity about exact form
- **exceptionally broad**: Physical size/breadth of transformed body
- **morning fog**: Weather imagery reinforcing anxiety and obscured perception
- **quarter to seven / seven o'clock**: Time pressure mounting as work obligations approach

### Connections
- Continues from: Chunk 1 established Gregor's initial waking realization of transformation; this chunk shows the concrete physical struggle and family's awakening to his problem
- Sets up: Family will soon become more directly confrontational; Gregor's physical entrapment and isolation will deepen; question of whether he can get dressed and go to work remains unresolved

### Translation Notes
- The voice transformation is described clinically and gradually - preserve the almost medical precision while maintaining psychological distress
- "Little legs" (Korean: 작은 다리들) should convey multiplicity and uncontrollability; maintain Kafka's deliberate vagueness about exact insect form
- Physical struggle descriptions are detailed and sensory-based - translate movement verbs precisely to maintain visceral quality
- Time markers (clock striking) build anxiety - these temporal references work universally in Korean context
- Gregor's rationalization of symptoms as "merely a cold" reflects denial that should be evident in translated speech patterns
- The contrast between the matter-of-fact narration and impossible situation should be preserved - this is central to Kafkaesque absurdism
- Maintain the internal monologue quality showing Gregor's psychological resistance to accepting reality despite physical evidence
