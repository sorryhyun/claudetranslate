## Chunk 2 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor attempts to get out of bed but discovers he has multiple small legs he cannot control. His family (mother, father, and sister) grow concerned when they hear his voice has become distorted and begin knocking on his door, but Gregor avoids opening it. He struggles physically for nearly an hour, making little progress, and eventually settles back in bed while observing the morning fog through the window.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **Gregor Samsa**: The protagonist, whose transformation is progressively revealed through physical control loss
- **travelling salesman/travelling**: Gregor's occupation, referenced as the source of his occupational hazard (the cold he incorrectly attributes his voice change to)
- **small legs**: The primary evidence of his metamorphosis; he has multiple uncontrollable legs instead of normal human limbs
- **voice change/squeaking**: The altered voice signal noticed by family members; initially misinterpreted as the onset of a cold
- **wooden door**: Barrier between Gregor and his family; prevents the truth of his transformation from being discovered
- **bedpost**: Physical obstacle during his failed attempt to move; causes injury to his sensitive lower body

### Connections
- **Continues from**: Chunk 1 established that Gregor woke as a "vermin" with an armour-like back. Chunk 2 reveals the full extent of his physical transformation through his attempts to move.
- **Sets up**: Gregor's physical disability and family concern will likely escalate in the next chunk; his isolation behind the door is temporary; the chief clerk's expected arrival will force a confrontation.

### Translation Notes
- The voice distortion requires careful translation that conveys both the uncontrollable squeaking and the recognizable words beneath—this creates cognitive dissonance mirroring Gregor's psychological state.
- The multiple small legs (plural) are crucial to the absurdist horror; preserve the specific count ambiguity the original text maintains.
- Time references (quarter to seven, seven o'clock) and the one-hour struggle establish the narrative's real-time precision—maintain exact temporal markers.
- Family relationships and dialogue tones are essential: mother's gentle voice, father's stern calls, sister's plaintive concern—these reveal character and family dynamics in Korean honorific speech.
- Gregor's rationalization (attributing voice change to a cold, an occupational hazard) showcases his psychological denial of the metamorphosis—this deflection should be clear in translation.
