## Chunk 2 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor attempts to get out of bed in response to time pressure and is interrupted by the arrival of the chief clerk, who demands an explanation for his absence from work. Despite his transformed state and physical difficulty, Gregor tries to maintain normalcy by insisting he is merely ill and promises to report to the office later, while his family expresses concern and confusion about his locked door.

- chief clerk: Authority figure from Gregor's workplace who arrives demanding explanation; represents institutional/employer pressure

### Translation Notes
- Time references (quarter past seven, ten past seven, eight o'clock) create mounting urgency - maintain precision
- Chief clerk's accusatory speech reflects hierarchical workplace dynamic - use Korean honorifics/speech levels to convey authority differential
- Dialogue alternates between family members and official visitor - ensure distinct voices through appropriate Korean register variations
- Gregor's internal dialogue contrasts with his attempted external composure - preserve psychological realism of trying to hide catastrophic condition
- Physical descriptions of Gregor's movement (clawing, rocking, using "little legs") become clearer - avoid over-specifying insect type
