## Chunk 1 Summary

### Brief Summary
This is the opening of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," establishing the central premise: Gregor Samsa awakens to find himself transformed into a vermin. The chunk follows his immediate physical confusion and shock, then shifts to his anxious internal monologue about missing work, workplace fears, family debts, and oversleeping—showing how bureaucratic and financial concerns override his impossible physical crisis. The tone is tragicomic: his body has become monstrous, yet his thoughts remain fixated on mundane professional anxiety.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **vermin**: The translation of Kafka's "Ungeziefer" (German). Must convey disgust without specifying exact insect type. Context: describes Gregor's transformed body
- **armour-like back**: Physical description of Gregor's transformed body. Key sensory detail requiring literal translation
- **travelling salesman**: Gregor's profession. Context: defines his social position and work obligations
- **textile samples**: Objects on his table. Context: concrete evidence of his commercial work
- **guest house**: Where salesmen stay. Context: location referenced during morning routine anxieties
- **furniture-rattling noise**: The alarm clock sound. Context: illustrates auditory detail and Gregor's past habits
- **trouble making train connections**: Work anxiety. Context: specific detail about commercial travel demands
- **workshy**: Derogatory term for lazy workers. Context: Gregor fears his boss will use this accusation against him
- **chief clerk/office assistant**: Authority figures. Context: boss's representative who monitors employee attendance

### Connections
- **Begins**: The novella's opening, introducing Gregor Samsa and his inexplicable transformation
- **Sets up**: Family's discovery of the transformation, the chief clerk's arrival at the apartment, workplace consequences, communication barriers, and escalating family crisis
- **Key relationships**: Gregor's relationship with his boss (fear-based), his parents (financial obligation), and unnamed sister (will appear later as caregiver)

### Translation Notes
- **Sentence structure**: Long, complex sentences with embedded clauses reflecting stream of consciousness. Korean translation must preserve psychological flow through connecting particles rather than attempting direct structural matching
- **Interior monologue**: Heavy use of free indirect discourse blending narrator and Gregor's thoughts. Maintain this in Korean without separation between narrative voice and character thoughts
- **Formal register**: Use 문어체 (literary written style) throughout—this is serious modernist literature, not colloquial speech
- **Speech levels for thoughts**: Gregor's internal monologue can be more informal (평서체), but maintain formality in third-person narrative
- **Cultural resonance**: The filial duty to parents and fear of dismissal will resonate strongly with Korean readers familiar with 효 (filial piety) and workplace hierarchies
- **Dialogue formatting**: Thoughts appear in double quotes without attribution. Preserve this stylistic choice in Korean
- **Time references**: Use Korean time notation (오전 6시 30분 등) for the clock times mentioned
- **Ambiguity preservation**: Kafka deliberately leaves the creature's exact nature vague. The Korean term for "vermin" (벌레, 해충) should maintain this uncertainty while conveying revulsion
- **Tragicomic tone**: The dark humor—an insect concerned about missing a business appointment—is central. Ensure Korean translation captures this absurdist juxtaposition
- **Psychological depth**: This chunk emphasizes Gregor's anxiety, guilt, and rationalization. The translation should convey his psychological entrapment even before understanding his physical imprisonment
