## Chunk 1 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor Samsa wakes to find himself mysteriously transformed into a horrifying vermin-like creature in his bed. As he struggles to understand his transformation and attempts to rise, his internal monologue reveals his anxieties about his job as a travelling salesman, his family's financial dependence on him, and his general dissatisfaction with his life. His family members check on him when they realize he's still home at an unusual hour, and he responds in a strangely altered voice that alarmed them.

### Key Terms in This Section
- Gregor Samsa: The protagonist, a travelling salesman who has mysteriously transformed into an insect-like creature
- vermin: The deliberately ambiguous term for what Gregor has become (original "Ungeziefer" should remain vague, not specified as particular insect)
- travelling salesman: Gregor's profession; important to his identity and source of financial obligation
- armour-like back: The hard, protective-seeming back surface of his transformed body
- textile samples: The commercial goods Gregor sells; currently unpacked on his table
- mother, father, sister (Grete): Family members whose voices enter the narrative
- alarm clock: Symbolic object representing time pressure and Gregor's obligations; critical to plot timing
- four o'clock/seven o'clock references: Precise temporal markers creating urgency around work commitments

### Connections
- **Begins:** The very opening of the novella - introduces the central transformation and Gregor's immediate crisis
- **Sets up:** Family's discovery of his condition, practical problems of his transformed state, deeper exploration of his work obligations and family dynamics in subsequent sections

### Translation Notes
- Maintain the matter-of-fact tone despite the surreal premise - Kafka describes horrifying transformation in mundane, realistic language
- Preserve the long, complex sentence structure with multiple subordinate clauses that reflect Gregor's anxious, circular thinking
- Keep "vermin" ambiguous; do not specify insect type. Consider Korean "벌레" or "해충" while maintaining disgust and uncertainty
- Maintain precise time references - temporal urgency is thematically crucial to the piece
- Preserve the psychological realism: despite fantastic transformation, Gregor's concerns remain mundanely realistic (missing work, disappointing parents)
- Handle "workshy" (workshy) with awareness of Korean workplace cultural context
- Dialogue should sound natural in Korean while maintaining distinct character voices through appropriate speech levels
- Sensory details (brown belly, thin legs, white spots) should be translated directly without euphemism
