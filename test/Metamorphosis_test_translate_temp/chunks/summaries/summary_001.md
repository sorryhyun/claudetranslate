## Chunk 1 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a repulsive insect-like creature, discovering his new body has a hard back, brown belly, and many thin legs. Initially attempting to deny the reality of his situation and go back to sleep, he becomes trapped in anxious internal monologue about his job as a travelling salesman, his family obligations, and mounting professional pressures as he realizes he will be late for work. His deliberation reveals deep resentment toward his career and employer, alongside his reluctant commitment to paying off family debt, all while physically struggling with his transformed body.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **Gregor Samsa**: The protagonist; a travelling salesman who has mysteriously transformed overnight
- **vermin**: The unnamed creature Gregor has become; deliberately left non-specific and disturbing
- **armour-like back**: Gregor's new hard, protective outer covering; suggests both insect carapace and defensive imagery
- **travelling salesman**: Gregor's occupation; a commercial profession involving constant movement and client interaction
- **textile samples**: Physical goods Gregor carries for his sales work
- **chief clerk**: His employer's representative; symbol of workplace authority and surveillance
- **family debt**: The financial obligation binding Gregor to his job; central to his psychological burden

### Connections
- **Opens the narrative**: This is the opening of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" establishing the impossible premise and Gregor's immediate psychological response
- **Sets up**: The family's discovery of his transformation, the chief clerk's visit, escalating conflicts with family members, and the entire arc of his physical and social decline
- **Thematic foundation**: Establishes key themes of alienation, dehumanization through labor, family obligation, and loss of bodily autonomy

### Translation Notes
- Maintain the matter-of-fact tone when describing the fantastical transformation; avoid adding emotional coloring
- Preserve the ambiguity of "vermin" rather than specifying an insect type
- Keep internal monologue's meandering, anxious quality using appropriate Korean sentence connectors
- Maintain exact time references (6:30, quarter to seven, etc.) as they build mounting pressure
- Balance tragicomic elements in physical descriptions of Gregor's helpless movements
- Preserve the deadpan narrative voice contrasted with Gregor's internal anxiety
- Honor Kafka's bureaucratic precision while keeping language accessible to contemporary readers
