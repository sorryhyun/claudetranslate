## Chunk 6 Summary

### Brief Summary
The chief clerk attempts to flee in panic after seeing Gregor's transformed state, but Gregor pursues him in a desperate attempt to save his job and family's financial future. The chase triggers a violent family response—Gregor's father drives him back toward his room with a stick and newspaper while the mother opens windows in shock, ultimately forcing Gregor through the doorway with painful injury before slamming the door shut, leaving silence.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **chief clerk**: Authority figure whose reaction to Gregor determines job security; flees in panic, representing societal rejection of Gregor's condition
- **protruding lips, trembling shoulders**: Physical descriptors of the clerk's horror and disgust
- **banister**: Central location where clerk hesitates before fleeing down stairs
- **father's stick, newspaper**: Weapons used to drive Gregor back—represent paternal authority turning violent
- **hissing noises**: Father's animalistic response; creates confusion for Gregor as he tries to move backwards
- **doorway, double doors**: Physical barrier preventing Gregor's passage; narrow space that injures him
- **numerous little legs**: Gregor's insect body parts; he discovers they function better than expected, giving brief hope
- **coffee pot knocked over**: Accidental domestic disruption; mother's panic causes her to spill coffee
- **heavily bleeding, deep into his room**: Injury result; Gregor is forcibly expelled with violence

### Connections
- **Continues from**: Previous chunk established the chief clerk's arrival to collect payment; Gregor's hope to persuade him now leads to this confrontation scene
- **Sets up**: The door slamming shut and silence suggests a turning point—Gregor is now isolated from the family and external world; establishes the claustrophobic containment that will dominate later sections

### Translation Notes
- **Directional language precision**: Kafka uses specific spatial terms (entrance hall, doorway, landing, stairs, staircase). Translator must maintain precise Korean spatial vocabulary to preserve the sense of trapped movement
- **Animalistic behavior**: Father's "hissing noises" and Gregor's physical desperation introduce animalistic imagery—important to convey the dehumanization theme without being crude
- **Family response differentiation**: Mother screams and flees; father becomes violent; each response reflects different family adaptation to crisis. Speech levels in Korean should reflect each character's emotional state
- **Physical description detail**: Gregor's body scraping the doorway, blood, quivering legs—Kafka's clinical, almost entomological precision here must translate to Korean without becoming gratuitously gruesome
- **Temporal markers**: "For the first time that day" suggests earlier failed attempts to move that aren't detailed; translator should recognize this narrative compression
- **Emotional contradiction**: Gregor feels "alright with his body" briefly despite the desperate situation—preserves Kafkaesque absurdism; tone should convey simultaneous relief and horror
- **Dialogue embedded in action**: Mother's "Help, for pity's sake, Help!" and Gregor's gentle "Mother, mother" occur within intense physical action—dialogue structure and emotional register shift needed in Korean
- **Psychophysical fusion**: The passage blends Gregor's psychological crisis (protecting his job/family) with his physical struggle (moving in insect form)—long Korean sentences with appropriate clause linking will preserve this fusion
