## Chunk 6 Summary

### Brief Summary
The chief clerk flees in panic down the stairs, triggering a violent response from Gregor's father who drives Gregor back toward his room with the chief clerk's stick and a newspaper, forcing him into the doorway where his body is painfully scraped and bruised before being shoved inside and shut away. This scene represents the complete breakdown of Gregor's attempt to maintain his role as dutiful worker and family provider, culminating in physical violence and total separation from the household.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **chief clerk**: The employer's representative whose frightened flight signals the definitive end of Gregor's hope to preserve his job and status
- **banister**: The staircase railing representing Gregor's inability to prevent the clerk's escape despite his desperate pursuit
- **stick/newspaper**: Tools of violence used by Gregor's father; weapons of rejection and forced isolation
- **entrance hall/landing**: Liminal spaces where Gregor attempts one final time to connect with the outside world before being violently excluded
- **little legs**: Despite Gregor's momentary relief at their functionality, they ultimately serve as instruments of humiliation rather than agency
- **carpet/coffee pot**: Domestic objects knocked over in chaos, symbolizing the destruction of family normalcy

- **flank scraped on white door**: Visceral injury marking the violent boundary between Gregor's attempted inclusion and forced exclusion
- **heavily bleeding**: The culmination of physical trauma, a final grotesque image as Gregor is literally cast out

### Connections
- Continues from: Chunk 5 established Gregor's failed attempt to convince the chief clerk of his continued work capacity; this chunk shows the violent rejection of that plea
- Sets up: The aftermath of this assault (not included in excerpt) where Gregor retreats, wounded and isolated, beginning the second phase of the novella focusing on his slow decline

### Translation Notes
- The prose here becomes more frantic and visceral, with shorter sentences reflecting urgency and chaos; this stylistic shift must be preserved in Korean
- Gregor's moment of physical relief ("began to feel alright with his body") is quickly undercut by horror—this rapid emotional swing is crucial to maintain
- The father's violence escalates from driving-back gestures to hissing and weapon-use; this escalation should feel inevitable rather than sudden
- The mother's panicked response (opening window, fleeing) contrasts with her earlier fainting—show her increasing helplessness through action rather than passive collapse
- The detailed description of Gregor's body getting stuck at the doorway (physical dimensions, angles, quivering legs) is simultaneously pathetic and horrifying; clinical precision maintains Kafka's tone
- The final image "heavily bleeding" and the slamming door followed by silence provides a traumatic punctuation—the peace that follows violence
- Father's "hissing" is a particularly dehumanizing sound choice by Kafka; convey this as reducing the father to something subhuman in his aggression, mirroring Gregor's own metamorphosis
