## Chunk 3 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor attempts to exit his bed and falls to the floor just as the chief clerk from work arrives at the apartment. Gregor's family (father, mother, and sister) try to convince him to open his locked door and meet with the clerk, who has come to investigate Gregor's failure to catch the early train, but Gregor refuses despite mounting family pressure and emotional distress.

### Key Terms in This Section
- chief clerk: Corporate authority figure investigating Gregor's absence from work; represents employer's distrust and rigid business hierarchy
- fretsaw: A hobby tool mentioned when mother describes Gregor's leisure activities to the chief clerk; reflects his limited personal life
- train/timetables: Specific temporal references that emphasize punctuality expectations and business obligations
- commerce: The business context invoked by the chief clerk when discussing work obligations
- carpet: Physical element that softens Gregor's fall from bed, reducing the noise
- adjoining room/doors: Spatial barriers that complicate communication between Gregor and family/visitor
- elastic back: Descriptor of Gregor's transformed body part that proves more resilient than expected

### Connections
- Continues from: Chunk 2 established Gregor's transformation and initial physical assessment of his new body
- Sets up: Chunk 4 will likely show escalating crisis as family and clerk pressure Gregor further, deepening the communication and social breakdown

### Translation Notes
- The chief clerk's visit represents a crucial turning point where Gregor's private crisis becomes a social/professional crisis. His refusal to open the door signals his awareness that he cannot face the outside world in his transformed state.
- Family dialogue reveals class consciousness and anxiety about employer relations in early 20th century context; preserve the hierarchical deference.
- Notice the contrast between mother's gentle defense ("He isn't well, please believe me") and the chief clerk's professional coldness regarding business obligations. This emotional dynamic is thematically important.
- The repeated references to specific times (ten past seven, quarter past seven, early train) should remain precise to maintain the mounting temporal pressure.
- Physical descriptions like "elastic back" and "muffled" sound contribute to the tragicomic tone—Gregor's situation is both horrifying and darkly humorous.
