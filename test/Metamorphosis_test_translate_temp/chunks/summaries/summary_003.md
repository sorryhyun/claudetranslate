## Chunk 3 Summary

### Brief Summary
The family and chief clerk discover Gregor's transformed state when he opens the door using only his mouth and jaw, causing horrified reactions from all present. Gregor, despite his grotesque appearance, attempts to reassure the chief clerk of his professional reliability and work ethic, but the clerk flees in panic while Gregor pursues him, discovering his newfound physical control with his multiple legs, prompting his mother to cry out for help.

### Key Terms in This Section
- chief clerk: Authority figure from Gregor's workplace; witnesses the transformation and serves as crucial representative to the firm
- commercial traveller: Gregor's profession/identity; he emphasizes his devotion to this role despite his condition
- samples: Business materials (textile samples) Gregor claims to pack for work, though now impossible to carry
- locksmith: Professional summoned by the father, ultimately unnecessary as Gregor opens the door himself
- lieutenant: Military rank referenced in photograph on the wall, indicating Gregor's former status and respect
- vermin: The unnamed nature of what Gregor has become (deliberately ambiguous in original)

### Connections
- Continues from: Previous chunk established Gregor's existence as transformed creature and family's initial shock
- Sets up: Family dynamics will further deteriorate; Gregor's attempts to maintain normalcy will clash with physical reality and others' horror

### Translation Notes
- Maintain the tension between Gregor's rational speech and his incomprehensible transformed voice—family members understand his intent but not his actual words
- The physical description of Gregor's body (no proper teeth, strong jaw, numerous little legs, adhesive on leg tips) should be rendered vividly without euphemism
- The chief clerk's retreat represents the external world's rejection of Gregor's condition; his panic is central to Gregor's social catastrophe
- Preserve the surreal juxtaposition: Gregor calmly discussing work obligations while maneuvering an insect body through a door
- Time references and spatial details (the flat layout, the hospital building visible across the street, breakfast items on table) ground the surreal in mundane realism
