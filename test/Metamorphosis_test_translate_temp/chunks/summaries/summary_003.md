## Chunk 003 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor struggles to get out of bed before 7:15 AM to avoid suspicion at work, planning to throw himself out of bed. As he prepares to jump, a visitor arrives at the door—the chief clerk from his company—prompting him to finally hurl himself out of bed in panic. After landing on the carpet, the chief clerk and Gregor's family members gather outside his locked bedroom door, with his parents and sister pleading with him to open it and explain his absence from work.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **chief clerk (지배인)**: The senior workplace authority who arrives to investigate Gregor's absence; represents institutional pressure and hierarchy
- **firm steps/firm footsteps**: Repeated descriptor for decisive, purposeful movement (chief clerk's authoritative presence)
- **swinging/swang out of bed**: Gregor's physical movement strategy; note unusual verb tense ("swang" for past tense)
- **elastic**: Gregor's back described as unexpectedly resilient when hitting the carpet
- **locked doors**: Barrier that intensifies the separation between Gregor and the outside world
- **muffled sound**: The fall makes less noise than expected, though still audible
- **sister whispered**: First clear indication of Grete's presence and concern
- **commercial traveller** / **company business**: References to Gregor's professional identity
- **fretsaw**: Mentioned by mother as evidence of Gregor's diligence and hobbies

### Connections
- **Continues from**: Previous chunk where Gregor discovers his transformed body and attempts to manage it within his normal routine; he was contemplating asking for help and worrying about the noise
- **Sets up**: Family confrontation at the bedroom door; Gregor must now reveal his condition or continue hiding while the chief clerk waits; escalating pressure from both workplace authority and family concern

### Translation Notes
- **Dialogue through doors**: Multiple characters speak to Gregor from different rooms, creating spatial/communication layering that should be preserved in Korean with clear speech attribution
- **Speech levels**: Chief clerk should use formal, condescending Korean (높임말); mother uses protective speech; father shows impatience; Gregor speaks slowly and thoughtfully
- **Time markers**: "quarter past seven," "ten past seven" use standard Korean time notation
- **Emotional contradictions**: Gregor suppresses a smile despite crisis (darkly ironic), and his sister cries while family argues—these psychological nuances should be evident
- **Interior monologue**: Gregor's bitter thoughts about workplace culture and suspicious employers should convey existential frustration while remaining matter-of-fact
- **Repeated descriptors**: "firm steps," "firm footsteps" appear twice; preserve repetition for psychological effect showing anxiety about authority
- **Ambiguous agency**: Notice the shift from Gregor's deliberation to action "because these thoughts had made him upset"—preserve the psychological trigger, not rational decision
