## Chunk 5 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor uses his jaw to turn the door key from inside, causing himself physical damage but successfully opening the door to reveal himself to his family and the chief clerk. The family reacts with horror—the mother faints, the father clenches his fists in hostility, and the chief clerk retreats in shock. Despite his physically transformed state, Gregor attempts to reassure the chief clerk that he remains a dedicated worker, pleading that his temporary inability to work should not damage his reputation or employment.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **adhesive on the tips of his legs**: Describes the physical modification allowing Gregor to cling to surfaces; critical detail of his vermin-like transformation
- **brown fluid from his mouth**: Bodily fluid damage caused by forcing the key; reinforces the grotesque, physical horror of his condition
- **chief clerk**: The employer's representative who must mediate between Gregor's work obligations and his transformed state; carries hierarchical power
- **commercial traveller**: Gregor's profession as a travelling salesman; central to his identity and family obligation
- **seriously in debt**: Financial burden driving Gregor's anxiety; motivates his desperate attempt to maintain employment
- **uniform and bearing**: Reference to Gregor's past as a lieutenant, contrasted with his current helpless state; marks his loss of former dignity

### Connections
- Continues from: Previous chunks established Gregor's transformation and his family's initial shock; this chunk escalates to the moment of visual revelation
- Sets up: The family's ongoing struggle to accept Gregor's condition and his attempts to maintain some role in the household despite his inability to work

### Translation Notes
- Gregor's speech in this section is notably calm and rational despite his physical horror; the juxtaposition of desperate, pleading content with controlled tone is crucial
- The detailed description of jaw and tooth damage provides visceral horror; must be rendered with clinical precision per Kafka's style
- Family members' emotional responses (mother's fainting, father's weeping) should preserve their restraint rather than add expressiveness
- Gregor's self-awareness about how his coughing might sound "different from a human cough" indicates his acute consciousness of no longer being human; this psychological detail is important for translation
- The photograph of young Gregor "as a lieutenant in the army" provides visual contrast between past identity and present state; culturally, this speaks to loss of status and masculine authority
- Gregor's monologue to the chief clerk reveals psychological realism—he rationally argues his case while physically unable to present himself as credible; this internal contradiction should be preserved
