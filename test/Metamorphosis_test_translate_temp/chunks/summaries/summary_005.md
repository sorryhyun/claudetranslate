## Chunk 5 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor makes a desperate attempt to open the locked door using his jaw and insect strength to prove he is still capable and worthy of employment, but when the door opens and the family sees his transformed body, they react with shock and horror—his mother faints, his father weeps in despair, and the chief clerk retreats in disgust. Despite the devastating family reaction, Gregor attempts to reassure them by speaking calmly about his work duties and asking the chief clerk to report favorably to his employer.

- Sets up: The family's permanent trauma and altered relationship with Gregor following this first exposure to his transformed state; the beginning of their emotional rejection of him despite his attempts at normalcy

### Translation Notes
- Gregor's speech to the chief clerk is excessively formal and deferential—preserve this through Korean honorific speech (극존칭/높임말) to emphasize his desperation to maintain workplace relationships despite his transformation
- The description of his jaw working the key and the "brown fluid" suggest biological change without explicit description—maintain clinical, matter-of-fact tone while preserving the disturbing implication
- Family reactions should reflect Korean emotional patterns: mother's faint showing overwhelming shame/shock, father's tears conveying deep despair about family misfortune, chief clerk's retreat showing social disgust
- The paragraph about the military photograph serves as tragic contrast between Gregor's honored past and degraded present—important symbolic moment requiring careful tonal handling
- Gregor's rationalization speech demonstrates his psychological denial and prioritization of work obligations over his physical transformation—maintain the tragicomic tension of treating the absurd as mundane
- Time references (office, report) maintain urgency theme established earlier
