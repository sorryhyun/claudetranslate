## Chunk 4 Summary

### Brief Summary
In this climactic scene, Gregor pursues the chief clerk fleeing down the stairs, but his father intervenes to drive him back to his room. Using the clerk's walking stick and a newspaper, the father physically forces the transformed Gregor backwards through the doorway; Gregor becomes stuck in the doorframe and is violently shoved through, injuring himself severely and leaving bloodstains. The scene ends with the door slammed shut and silence restored.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **chief clerk**: The authority figure and symbol of workplace hierarchy who flees in horror at Gregor's appearance
- **stick (walking stick)**: The physical instrument of violence used by Gregor's father to drive him back
- **doorway/doorframe**: The narrow physical barrier that traps Gregor as he tries to escape the family's panic
- **father**: Shifts from relatively self-controlled observer to violent actor, showing decisive aggression
- **brown flecks/bleeding**: Visceral injury details emphasizing Gregor's pain and vulnerability
- **hissing**: Sound used to frighten Gregor, suggesting animalistic treatment

### Connections
- **Continues from**: Chunk 3's scene of family horror at Gregor's appearance and the chief clerk's arrival; the accumulating family panic
- **Sets up**: This appears to be the final chunk, ending with Gregor isolated in his room and the household restored to silence—establishing the confinement that will define subsequent narrative developments

### Translation Notes
- The father's hissing ("like a wild man") is a key detail conveying dehumanization of the attacker
- The precise physical comedy of Gregor's inability to move backwards and navigate the narrow doorway maintains Kafka's blend of absurd horror with physical realism
- Maintain matter-of-fact tone even during the violence; the narrator's detachment makes the scene more disturbing
- The "vile brown flecks" reference maintains the text's visceral imagery without specification of what the body fluid is
- Father's use of the clerk's stick adds shame/rejection dimension—the family's property used as a weapon
- The spatial blocking (turning slowly, hissing from distance, final violent shove) requires careful translation of movement and direction verbs
