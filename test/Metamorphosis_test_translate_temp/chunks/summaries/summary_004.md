## Chunk 4 Summary

### Brief Summary
The chief clerk confronts Gregor through the locked door, demanding explanation for his absence and threatening his job security. Gregor attempts to respond and physically attempts to open the door, but when his voice is heard—clearly transformed into "the voice of an animal"—the family realizes the gravity of his condition and they rush to call a doctor and locksmith.

### Key Terms in This Section
- **chief clerk**: Authority figure acting as employer's representative, demanding accountability; speaks with formal condescension
- **voice of an animal**: Crucial moment of revelation—Gregor's transformation becomes physically apparent through speech rather than sight
- **turnover/business duties**: References to Gregor's job performance and commercial responsibilities
- **dizziness/unwell**: Gregor's attempt to rationalize his condition with conventional illness excuse
- **eight o'clock train**: Recurring time marker representing Gregor's work obligations
- **incomprehensible stubbornness**: Chief clerk's misinterpretation of Gregor's silence as defiance

### Connections
- **Continues from**: Gregor's anxious interior monologue about his sister's concerns and family obligations; shifts from internal perspective to external pressure when chief clerk raises his voice
- **Sets up**: Family's collective realization of crisis; transition from denial to urgent action (calling doctor and locksmith); escalation of panic and emotional responses

### Translation Notes
- The chief clerk's speech requires marked formality and condescension in Korean (극존칭 mixed with dismissive tone) to contrast with Gregor's deferential response
- "Voice of an animal" is the pivotal sensory revelation—must convey shock and wrongness while remaining descriptive
- Gregor's rambling excuses show internal panic beneath surface politeness; Korean should capture this tension between honorific speech and incoherent reasoning
- The phrase about sliding down the drawers and finally standing upright shows physical struggle—translate with clinical detail matching Kafka's style
- Family members' exclamations ("Oh, God!", "Mother?", "Grete!") are rapid, fragmented—preserve this in Korean to show emotional chaos
- The chief clerk's calm observation contrasting with the mother's screams creates dark irony; maintain this tonal contrast
- Note the open door at the end (symbolic barrier breaking down) and the cultural detail about leaving it open in times of crisis
