## Chunk 004 Summary

### Brief Summary
Gregor panics and makes excuses about illness to the chief clerk while desperately attempting to leave his bed and open the door. His family recognizes his transformed voice as inhuman, and his father summons a locksmith while his mother and sister rush out to find a doctor, leaving the front door open in their panic.

### Key Terms in This Section
- chief clerk: The employer's representative who has come to investigate Gregor's absence and monetary accountability
- business duties/turnover: Gregor's professional obligations and sales performance being scrutinized
- eight o'clock train: Specific temporal anchor suggesting Gregor's usual work schedule and his desperate attempt to maintain normalcy
- attack of dizziness: The false excuse Gregor invents to explain his inability to appear
- voice of an animal: The crucial moment when family and clerk recognize that Gregor's voice has become inhuman, confirming transformation

### Connections
- Continues from: Previous tension of family waiting outside, chief clerk's arrival, Gregor's internal debate about opening the door
- Sets up: Escalating family crisis response (calling doctor, locksmith), physical attempts to force entry or unlock door, revelation of Gregor's monstrous state to multiple witnesses

### Translation Notes
- Gregor's rushed, breathless dialogue ("But Sir", "Just a moment", "Be patient!") should convey panic and physical effort; use appropriate Korean conversational markers
- The chief clerk's formal accusations (about money entrusted, unsatisfactory turnover, business failures) use business Korean terminology - maintain bureaucratic tone
- Mother's shift from concern to realization ("he could be seriously ill and we're making him suffer") shows emotional escalation - use appropriate Korean family speech levels
- Key phrase "voice of an animal" (line 84) is the turning point: this is the moment of recognition - handle with gravitas
- Father's rapid command "get a locksmith here, now!" should convey urgent authority with appropriate honorific Korean imperative forms
- Preserve the specific time reference "eight o'clock train" - maintains mounting temporal pressure throughout narrative
