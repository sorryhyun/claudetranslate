## Document Context Analysis

### Domain
Primary: Literary Fiction
Secondary: Existential/Psychological Literature
Specialized subdomain: Early 20th-century modernist literature, specifically Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" (Die Verwandlung). This is a canonical work of absurdist/existentialist fiction dealing with themes of alienation, identity, and familial obligation.

### Audience
Target readers: General literary audience, students of literature, readers interested in classic modernist fiction
Technical expertise level: Intermediate - assumes familiarity with literary conventions but not necessarily academic expertise
Expected use: Literary appreciation, educational study, cultural enrichment

### Tone and Register
Formality: Semi-formal literary prose
Voice preference: Third-person limited omniscient narration, primarily following Gregor's perspective with occasional objective descriptions
Narrative person: Third person, though deeply intimate with protagonist's thoughts
Emotional tone: Disturbing, surreal, yet matter-of-fact; combines the absurd (man transformed into insect) with mundane realism (work obligations, family dynamics). The tone oscillates between Gregor's anxious internal monologue and detached external observation.

### Key Terminology

| Term | Suggested Approach | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| vermin | Translate with care | German "Ungeziefer" is deliberately ambiguous. Korean should maintain the disgust and ambiguity rather than specifying exact insect type. Consider "벌레" or "해충" |
| armour-like back | Literal translation | Physical description of transformation - "갑옷 같은 등" |
| travelling salesman | Cultural equivalent | "외판원" or "여행하는 세일즈맨" - important to Gregor's identity |
| chief clerk | Translate consistently | "과장" or "수석 사무원" - represents authority and workplace hierarchy |
| textile samples | Literal translation | "직물 견본" - specific to his profession |
| Mr. Samsa | Keep romanized + honorific | "삼자 씨" or maintain "Mr. Samsa" with Korean honorifics |
| Gregor | Keep romanized | "그레고르" - consistent romanization throughout |
| Grete | Keep romanized | "그레테" - sister's name |
| furniture-rattling noise | Vivid imagery | Maintain the sensory vividness in translation |
| workshy | Cultural concept | Consider Korean workplace culture equivalent for this judgment |
| commercial traveller | Synonym variation | Same as "travelling salesman" - maintain consistency |
| locksmith | Literal translation | "자물쇠 수리공" |
| fretsaw | Specific tool | "실톱" or "프렛소" - shows Gregor's modest hobbies |

### Style Guidelines
- Sentence structure: Kafka employs long, complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses that reflect Gregor's anxious, circular thinking. Korean translation should maintain this syntactic complexity where possible, though some restructuring may be necessary for clarity.
- Paragraph length: Variable - from single-sentence paragraphs for dramatic effect to long, dense paragraphs mirroring Gregor's mental state
- Formatting conventions: Standard prose narrative; dialogue integrated within paragraphs using quotation marks
- Special patterns:
  - Internal monologue in italics-equivalent ("What's happened to me?")
  - Seamless shifts between Gregor's thoughts and external action
  - Repetition for emphasis ("Gregor, Gregor")
  - Free indirect discourse blending narrator and character perspective

### Cultural Adaptation Notes
- Time references: "quarter to seven", "half past six" - maintain precision as time pressure is thematically crucial
- Workplace culture: The authoritarian employer-employee relationship may resonate differently in Korean context; maintain the oppressive atmosphere while being mindful of Korean workplace dynamics
- Family hierarchy: The family structure (dutiful son supporting parents and sister) has strong parallels in Korean culture - this aspect should translate naturally
- Religious references: "God in Heaven!", "Oh, God" - adapt to Korean expressions of dismay while maintaining intensity ("세상에!", "오, 하느님")
- Economic anxiety: Gregor's debt to employer for parents' obligations - this financial entrapment is culturally translatable
- Domestic details: Room layout, furniture, breakfast routines - maintain the European early-1900s setting without over-exoticizing
- Military reference: Photograph of Gregor as lieutenant - "중위" maintains the social status implication

### Translation Recommendations
1. **Maintain ambiguity of transformation**: The text never explicitly names what Gregor has become. Avoid over-specifying (e.g., don't use "바퀴벌레" cockroach if the source says "vermin"). Preserve Kafka's deliberate vagueness.

2. **Preserve psychological realism within absurdity**: Despite the fantastic premise, Gregor's concerns are mundanely realistic (missing work, disappointing parents). Korean translation should maintain this tonal contrast between the surreal situation and ordinary worries.

3. **Respect syntactic complexity**: Kafka's long, winding sentences mirror mental processes. While Korean syntax differs, attempt to maintain sentence length and complexity rather than over-simplifying into short, choppy sentences.

4. **Handle temporal urgency**: The precise time references (quarter to seven, seven o'clock, ten past seven) create mounting pressure. Maintain this specificity and urgency in Korean.

5. **Dialogue naturalization**: Speech should sound natural in Korean while preserving character relationships. The chief clerk's formal accusations, mother's worry, father's authority - each voice should be distinct through appropriate Korean speech levels and vocabulary.

6. **Sensory details**: Physical descriptions are crucial (brown belly, thin legs, brown fluid from mouth). Translate these visceral details directly without euphemism.

7. **Workplace terminology**: Use Korean equivalents for "travelling salesman", "chief clerk", "office assistant" that convey appropriate social/professional hierarchy.

8. **Emotional restraint**: The narrator's tone is often detached even during disturbing events. Avoid adding emotional intensifiers not present in the source; let the horror emerge from matter-of-fact description.

9. **Internal vs. external perspective**: Track carefully when the narrative is in Gregor's mind versus external observation. Korean grammar can mark this through sentence-ending particles and evidentiality markers.

10. **Literary register**: This is classic literature, not contemporary fiction. Use a Korean register appropriate for established literary works - neither archaic nor overly colloquial.
