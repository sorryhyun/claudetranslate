### Key Terminology

| Term | Suggested Approach | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|

| armour-like back | Literal translation | 갑옷 같은 등 - Important physical description |
| travelling salesman | Translate | 외판원, 여행 판매원 - Key to Gregor's social position |
| chief clerk | Translate consistently | 지배인, 주임 - Hierarchical workplace term, appears frequently |
| guest house | Cultural adaptation | 여관 or contextual equivalent |
| fretsaw | Technical term | 실톱 - Woodworking hobby detail |
| textile samples | Literal translation | 직물 견본 - Important to his profession |
| furniture-rattling noise | Descriptive translation | Preserves the sensory vividness |
| workshy | Translate concept | 일을 게을리하는 - Pejorative term for lazy workers |

### Character Names
- Gregor Samsa - Keep in original (그레고르 잠자)
- Grete - Keep in original (그레테) - His sister's name
- Anna - Keep in original (안나) - The maid

### Style Guidelines

**Sentence structure:**
- Long, complex sentences with multiple embedded clauses reflecting stream of consciousness
- Mixture of narrative description and interior monologue
- Frequent use of semicolons to connect related thoughts
- Extended paragraphs (some over 20 lines) maintaining continuous thought flow
- Shifting between external physical description and internal psychological reflection

**Narrative technique:**
- Free indirect discourse blending narrator and protagonist's voice
- Detailed, almost clinical description of physical sensations and movements
- Gradual revelation of backstory through Gregor's anxious ruminations
- Kafkaesque absurdism: extraordinary situation treated with mundane practicality

**Pacing and rhythm:**
- Deliberate, methodical pacing matching Gregor's struggle with his new body
- Acceleration during moments of crisis (chief clerk's arrival, family confrontations)
- Repetitive thought patterns reflecting psychological entrapment

**Dialogue formatting:**
- Dialogue embedded in paragraphs, not separated
- Thoughts in double quotes without attribution tags in some cases
- Speech through the door creates layers of communication barriers

### Cultural Adaptation Notes for Korean Translation

**Social hierarchy and workplace culture:**
- The rigid employer-employee relationship and fear of dismissal will resonate with Korean workplace culture
- The concept of filial duty (Gregor supporting parents and paying off their debts) aligns well with Korean 효 (filial piety) values
- The chief clerk's authority and formality should reflect Korean hierarchical speech patterns (존댓말)

**Family dynamics:**
- Three-generation family living together is culturally familiar
- The shame and crisis of potentially losing employment has strong cultural parallels
- Mother's emotional response, father's anger, sister's practical concern fit Korean family communication patterns

**Temporal and numerical references:**
- Clock times (4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, half past six, quarter to seven, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock train) - Use Korean time notation
- "five or six years" - Direct translation works
- Morning routine and work schedule details are culturally universal

**Spatial and domestic details:**
- European apartment/flat layout with multiple rooms and doors
- Bedroom privacy and locked doors
- Guest house (여관 or consider 하숙집 for period accuracy)

**Idiomatic expressions requiring adaptation:**
- "It can all go to Hell!" - Needs culturally appropriate Korean curse/expression
- "life of luxury" - 호화로운 생활
- "kicked out on the spot" - Convey immediacy of dismissal
- "God in Heaven!" - Consider Korean exclamation (하늘이시여, 세상에)
- "Oh, God" - 오, 하느님 or 맙소사

**Register and formality:**
- Gregor's speech to the chief clerk should be extremely deferential (높임말)
- Internal thoughts can be more informal
- Family dialogue requires Korean age/relationship-based speech levels
- Chief clerk's speech should be condescendingly formal

### Literary and Stylistic Considerations

**Kafkaesque elements to preserve:**
- The matter-of-fact tone describing impossible situations
- Bureaucratic anxiety and social alienation
- Physical entrapment mirroring psychological imprisonment
- Darkly comic juxtaposition of mundane concerns with absurd reality

**Psychological depth:**
- Gregor's self-denial about his transformation
- His prioritization of work obligations over impossible physical crisis
- Guilt about failing family responsibilities
- Fear of authority figures
- Gradual realization of his helplessness

**Symbolic elements:**
- The locked door as barrier between self and society
- The inability to communicate (voice transformation)
- The picture of the lady in furs (only possession he values)
- Physical struggle as metaphor for existential struggle
- Time pressure and lateness as anxiety manifestation

**Imagery requiring careful translation:**
- Physical descriptions of transformed body must be both specific and disturbing
- Weather imagery (rain, fog, dull morning) reinforcing mood
- Domestic space descriptions creating claustrophobic atmosphere

### Translation Recommendations

1. **Maintain the formal literary register:** Korean translation should use 문어체 (written literary style) rather than 구어체 (colloquial style), appropriate for serious literature

2. **Preserve sentence complexity:** While Korean syntax differs from English/German, maintain the psychological flow of long, anxious ruminations through appropriate use of connecting particles and clause structures

3. **Handle dialogue hierarchy carefully:** Use appropriate Korean speech levels (반말/존댓말) to reflect social relationships - Gregor to chief clerk (극존칭), family dialogue (varying by relationship), Gregor's thoughts (평서체)

4. **Maintain ambiguity about the insect type:** Kafka deliberately avoided specifying the exact creature. Korean term should preserve this vagueness while conveying revulsion

5. **Cultural localization of time pressure:** The anxiety about catching specific trains and workplace punctuality translates well to Korean work culture - emphasize this universal experience

6. **Preserve the tragicomic tone:** Balance horror with mundane bureaucratic concerns - this dark humor is central to Kafka's style

7. **Interior monologue flow:** Use Korean stream-of-consciousness techniques to preserve the blending of thought and narration

8. **Physical description precision:** Kafka's detailed, almost entomological descriptions of movement and sensation should remain vivid and unsettling

9. **Repetition and rhythm:** Kafka uses repetitive patterns for psychological effect - preserve these in Korean translation

10. **Historical/period setting:** Early 1900s Central European context - consider whether to add subtle period markers in Korean or let context speak for itself

### Specific Challenges for Korean Translation

**Grammar and syntax:**
- German/English complex subordinate clauses → Korean clause-linking patterns
- Passive voice frequency → Korean typically prefers active constructions
- Continuous tenses describing ongoing struggle → Korean aspectual markers

**Cultural concepts:**
- European commercial travel profession → Explain context if needed
- Debt to employer system → Culturally understandable in Korean historical context
- Living room/bedroom apartment layout → May need spatial clarity for Korean readers

**Tonal nuances:**
- Gregor's excessive politeness even in crisis → Korean has rich honorific system to convey this
- Bureaucratic coldness of chief clerk → Formal Korean speech can capture this well
- Family's shifting emotions → Korean emotional vocabulary is well-suited

**Philosophical undertones:**
- Existential alienation → Universal theme, translates conceptually
- Loss of humanity/identity → Preserve philosophical weight
- Absurdist logic → Maintain the dreamlike yet concrete quality

### Quality Metrics for Translation

A successful Korean translation should:
- Preserve the unsettling, dreamlike quality of the narrative
- Maintain psychological intimacy with Gregor's consciousness
- Convey the dark humor beneath the horror
- Reflect appropriate social hierarchies through speech levels
- Keep sentence rhythms that create anxiety and claustrophobia
- Make the impossible transformation feel mundane and matter-of-fact
- Preserve Kafka's precise, almost scientific description style
- Maintain the literary weight and philosophical depth of the original

### Additional Context Notes

This excerpt ends mid-scene (Part I is not complete), so the translation should anticipate continuation. The text establishes key themes that develop throughout the novella: family obligation, workplace dehumanization, communication breakdown, physical imprisonment, and social alienation.

The Korean literary tradition has strong precedents for psychological fiction and social alienation narratives, which should inform translation choices to resonate with Korean readers while preserving Kafka's unique modernist voice.
