| Term | Suggested Approach | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Gregor Samsa | Transliterate | Proper name - use consistent romanization: 그레고르 잠자 |
| vermin | Translate carefully | Central metaphor; Korean options: 벌레, 해충 - context requires non-specific insect/creature |

| chief clerk | Translate | 주임 or 과장 - hierarchical business title |
| armour-like | Translate with care | 갑옷 같은 - important visual/protective imagery |
| floundering | Translate expressively | 허우적거리는 - conveys helplessness |
| textile samples | Translate | 직물 견본 - specific to his profession |
| fretsaw | Translate or explain | 실톱, 세공용 톱 - hobby tool, may need cultural context |
| transformation/transformed | Translate consistently | 변신하다, 변형되다 - central thematic concept |

### Style Guidelines
- Sentence structure: Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses reflecting Gregor's stream of consciousness and internal deliberation; occasional shorter sentences for dramatic effect or dialogue
- Paragraph length: Generally long paragraphs (especially internal monologue sections) contrasted with shorter dialogue exchanges
- Formatting conventions: Dialogue marked with quotation marks and "said/called/thought" attributions; seamless transitions between external action and internal thought
- Temporal pacing: Detailed, almost real-time narration of morning events; time references are specific (half past six, quarter to seven, seven o'clock)
- Physical description: Precise, clinical detail of bodily transformation and movement difficulties
- Special patterns:
  - Frequent use of em-dashes for interrupted thoughts
  - Internal questions reflecting protagonist's confusion and anxiety
  - Repetition of key phrases for emphasis (e.g., "he thought")
  - Matter-of-fact narration of fantastical premise

### Cultural Adaptation Notes

**For Korean Translation:**

1. **Formal address and family hierarchy**: Korean requires careful handling of honorifics and family relationships. The family dynamics (parents, sister Grete) should use appropriate Korean familial terms (어머니/아버지/여동생) with suitable speech levels in dialogue.

2. **Work culture and hierarchy**: The employer-employee relationship and the concept of the "chief clerk" visiting a worker's home reflects early 20th century European work culture. This power dynamic should be preserved in Korean with appropriate honorific language and hierarchical markers.

3. **Time and routine**: The emphasis on punctuality, train schedules, and rigid work expectations may resonate differently in Korean context but should maintain the oppressive quality of Gregor's work life.

4. **Physical space**: The description of the room, doors, and apartment layout follows European architecture. Keep spatial descriptions clear without excessive localization.

5. **Emotional restraint vs. expression**: The family's German emotional restraint (mother's gentle voice, sister's quiet crying) should be preserved rather than adapted to more expressive Korean cultural norms, as this restraint is thematically significant.

6. **Debt and obligation**: The concept of family debt (Gregor working to pay off parents' debt to employer) has strong resonance in Korean culture - this theme should translate well with appropriate emphasis.

7. **Gender roles**: Period-appropriate gender dynamics (mother's domestic role, sister's dependence, male breadwinner pressure) should be preserved as historical/literary context.

### Translation Recommendations

1. **Maintain the deadpan tone**: The narrator's matter-of-fact reporting of Gregor's impossible transformation is essential to Kafka's style. Avoid adding emotional coloring or explanatory language that isn't in the original.

2. **Preserve ambiguity**: The text never explicitly names what kind of creature Gregor has become (only "vermin"). Maintain this productive ambiguity in Korean rather than specifying an insect type.

3. **Internal monologue flow**: The long passages of Gregor's thoughts should maintain their meandering, anxious quality. Use Korean sentence connectors that preserve the stream-of-consciousness feel without fragmenting the flow.

4. **Temporal precision**: Keep all specific time references exact - they build mounting pressure and anxiety throughout the narrative.

5. **Physical comedy and horror**: The detailed descriptions of Gregor's failed attempts to move, get out of bed, and turn the door key have both comic and horrifying elements. Maintain this tragicomic balance.

6. **Dialogue attribution**: Carefully distinguish between spoken dialogue, thoughts, and narrative voice. Korean grammar allows for smooth integration of these levels.

7. **Repetition for effect**: When the text repeats phrases ("he thought," "Gregor," character names in dialogue), preserve this repetition as it serves rhythmic and psychological functions.

8. **Professional terminology**: Terms related to Gregor's work (travelling salesman, samples, contracts, turnover) should use appropriate business Korean while remaining accessible to general readers.

9. **Family dynamics**: Dialogue between family members should reflect:
   - Mother's gentle, worried tone (존댓말 towards Gregor if culturally appropriate, or intimate family speech)
   - Father's authoritative, eventually aggressive tone
   - Sister Grete's concerned but younger sibling relationship
   - Chief clerk's professional but increasingly hostile tone

10. **Sensory details**: Preserve vivid sensory descriptions (rain hitting window, brown belly, white spots, brown fluid from mouth, furniture-rattling noise of alarm clock) as they ground the surreal premise in physical reality.

11. **Psychological realism**: Despite the impossible premise, Gregor's emotional responses (worry about work, consideration of family, frustration with his body) are psychologically realistic. Maintain this emotional authenticity.

12. **Pacing in crisis moments**: The escalating tension (family knocking, chief clerk arriving, Gregor's desperate explanations, final confrontation) should build naturally in Korean with appropriate urgency markers.

### Additional Context for Translator

This is the opening section of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" (Die Verwandlung, 1915), one of the most influential works of 20th century literature. The excerpt covers the morning Gregor Samsa wakes as an insect-like creature and his first interactions with his family and employer.

Key thematic elements to preserve:
- **Alienation and isolation** - despite physical proximity to family
- **Dehumanization through labor** - Gregor's identity entirely tied to work
- **Family obligation and guilt** - debt as literal and psychological burden
- **Communication breakdown** - inability to be understood despite effort
- **Bodily autonomy loss** - loss of control paralleling loss of human status
- **Bureaucratic absurdity** - rigid work expectations despite impossible circumstances

The Korean translation should honor Kafka's precise, somewhat bureaucratic prose style while remaining accessible to contemporary readers. This is established literary classic that Korean readers will approach with serious literary expectations.
